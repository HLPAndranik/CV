        <h3>Game Development</h3>
        <p>I started learning to code when I was 13. I've always wanted to make my own game.
          My first game was written in Visual Basic 6.0 (that was so painful).
          After that i've learned python /pygame library/ and created a Mario style game for my collage diploma /95/100 because my game was endless üòÅ/.
          And finally Unity 3D the best game engine for lone wolf /or owl/
